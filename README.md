# Colour tokens overview

Web site that shows an overview of colours and colour classes in Warp, and the mapping between these. 

Currently the site only contains colours for the FINN Light theme. The colours are loaded from YAML files during runtime in order to always be updated.

The project was created by a designers, so don't expect the code to be perfect.
